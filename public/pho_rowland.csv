0,"This place was so good! I came here with a friend at 8pm on a Monday night so it was empty except for me. The place is well lit and extremely spacious. I ordered the egg rolls, a large combo pho(+beef balls), the banh xeo, and a side of grilled pork. Food came extremely fast. Those fried egg rolls are incredible. So crispy with the perfect amount of filling. The combo pho was huge with the noodles perfectly cooked and the beef not overcooked like a lot of places tend to do it. By the time the banh xeo came, I was pretty full even though I was splitting it with my friend. The shell was super crispy and there was a lot of bean sprouts in there which is the way I like my banh xeo. Definitely would recommend this place! Prices are super reasonable.

1,"Pretty solid place to get Vietnamese food! I ordered the bun rieu and I personally thought the broth was a bit bland and I wish I had gotten a rice dish instead but to be fair I like when the soup is more pungent. It's great for people who are unfamiliar with that specific dish and want to try it, though! It also came with a lot of protein and the perfect amount of noodles. As for the pho, my boyfriend ordered it and he said it was really good! It was moderately busy when I went on a Sunday afternoon but we didn't have to wait for a table. The service was quick and they have a lot of options on the menu if you're feeling soupy, dry, rice, noodles, or even something else. It's located in the same plaza as a lot of other popular business (Chicha San Chen, Sun Nong Dan, etc) so it might be a bit difficult to find parking even though there are a lot of spots.

2,"Pho prices are getting out of hand. $17 for 3 bites of noodles and measly pieces of meat? $16 for 5 egg rolls? If you have a big appetite, prepare to be broke after your meal. Dined in on a Thursday around 6-6:30pm. Only 2 other parties in the restaurant. I know the economy is bad and everything is expensive but these prices gotta go. This used to be my go to spot in 2015-2019 but I don't think I'll be back. Can't justify a bowl of pho setting me back $20. Pho 45 in La habra is good with big portions and reasonable prices. Always busy there but too bad it's a little far. Somebody open a decently priced pho place in the Rowland heights area, I promise business will be very good! P.S. their recent 5 star reviews are looking a little suspicious.. very short and nonspecific with fake looking profiles.. not sure if they're offering some sort of incentive for writing 5 star reviews but it not a good look.

8,"Pho Rowland Restaurant is still our favorite Vietnamese Restaurant in Rowland Heights. We ordered the following items today: -#49 Bun Rieu (crab meat, shrimp & pork w/ vermicelli soup) $17.50 -#19 Pho Dac Biet (Special Combo w/ ribeye steak, tendon, tripe & brisket) $16.25 -#60 Com Bi Cha Suon (shredded pork, egg loaf & grilled pork chop) $17 -#1 Cha Gio (crispy egg rolls w/ pork, vegetables & fish sauce) 5 pcs $16 -#18 Soda Lemonade/Pickled lemon/Pickled Plum $6 -#16 Vietnamese coffee w/ condensed milk $6 Our appetizer Cha Gio (crispy egg rolls with pork and veggies) came out first. They looked very appealing and crispy. The egg rolls were big, with veggies and some rice noodles to wrap with. They made it fresh so they were very hot when served on the table. They were so delicious and as good as Golden Deli. The Pho Dac Biet (A special combo with ribeye steak, tendon, tripe & brisket) was flavorful and the soup was not too salty. The ribeye steak meat was very tender and had a lot of tendon, trip & brisket. The portion was decent. Com Bi Cha Suon (shredded pork, egg loaf & grilled pork chop). The grilled pork chop tasted flavorful but it was a bit dry. The egg loaf and shredded pork were also yummy. The Crab meat, shrimp & pork with vermicelli soup was very addictive. This is a traditional Vietnamese soup with a flavorful broth flavored with tomatoes, shrimp paste, fish sauce, and a meat broth. The taste was on point. The prices are a little pricey compared to other Vietnamese restaurants in the area. Total was $86 for 3 adults (plus tips). They even charged $0.25 for the take-out boxes.

If I feel that I am going to rate a 1 or 2 stars, heck I'll even wait hours, days just to let time pass. Oh well. Here it is. Pho Rowland. I have dined here multiple times. It's not fantastic (Dining at several different pho restaurants in my time). For what you get, prices are a bit high. On average of $14plus tax on a bowl of Pho is standard at excellent to mid ranged Pho restaurants. Here the bowl is a standard $14, however the only perk is that you get the bowl quickly after ordering. Everything else is lacking. A slightly sour broth, tough beef and stringy noodles. Sure, this is fine if the bowl had a lower price point, but it isn't. Service is unacceptable. There is a sign in sheet for dine-in que that is not utilized. Our party arrived and were told to wait a moment as all tables were full. We placed our name and party number. A separate party arrived shortly after (45 seconds) and were seated, not using the sign-in sheet. It was confirmed with staff that the other party did not reserve a table nor provided earlier notification. Maybe it was because the other party was donned in designer clothing brands? Who knows. The restaurant was full and busy, I get it. However, management control to organize seating is important. If quality control is this lacking, how lacking can it be in other areas of the business? QC in the kitchen? QC of cleanliness? Some days the broth tastes average, some days overly sour.

I loveeed the big bag of lettuce and herbs that accompanied the banh xeo. You can make each bite a different experience! There are so many different textures and contrasting flavors from the sweetness that comes from the crisp, pickled julienned carrots and daikon to the herby freshness that comes from adding cilantro and mint to the savory crepe.

89,"Vibe: Typical Vietnamese restaurant Service: Friendly Food: Reading my last review, I seemed to have enjoyed the summer rolls a lot but now, not so much. I'm not sure if they've changed things or if my taste buds changed but I'm not feeling it anymore. I'd pass on this next time. I've also recently had the bun rieu and pho combo - both pretty good, and egg rolls (SOOO good). The only thing that really stood out to me were the egg rolls. Parking: Located in a business plaza which can get busy depending on when you go. There are many other restaurants in the plaza.",4,0.8556,positive,"[0.5023, -0.2584, 0.0, 0.7269, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0]",anticipation,,,,,,,0.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

91,"Was in the neighborhood of Roland Heights. Since it rain last night , I was in the mood for some Pho. OMG! This place was clean, I ordered the chicken Pho which is my normal go to for pho. The chicken pho came with the traditional beef broth, this was an excellent broth! You can taste all the ingredients in this broth, star anise, nothing was over powering. This chicken was both white and brown meat which made it to die for! I also ordered bean curd shrimp paste and egg roll, it's nice you can get these individually and not have to order (5) egg rolls. Price range is within most restaurants. If your ever in town you must stop in this place for some good home some pho. I highly recommend it.",5,0.8648,positive,"[0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.4019, 0.6114, 0.0, -0.636, 0.4215, 0.0, 0.1779, 0.4201]",positive,,,,,,,0.765,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

93,"Local Vietnamese eatery with some of the best fried egg rolls I've ever had. My sister swore by the egg rolls, so the fam came here on a Sunday for dinner around 6pm and got seated immediately. They're open during covid for indoor dining (no outdoor options) as well as pick-up/delivery via the usual suspects. They take credit cards, and parking is available in the lot. The place had a steady stream of customers and all the tables were occupied while we were there. Masks are required. Going back to the egg rolls (cha gio on the menu), they come piping hot and you wrap them with lettuce and can dip them in fish sauce. There's five to an order, and you HAVE to get them. For the pho, they're only currently serving the large size. The broth is aromatic and holds well for leftovers. I got the bun bo hue which came with a super generous amount of meat. The broth wasn't that spicy, but it was certainly savory and tasty. There are other dishes available if you don't want pho, but there are pl...",5,0.8798,positive,"[0.6369, 0.0, -0.0772, 0.3818, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.2732, 0.802, 0.4767, -0.0286]",positive,,,,,,,0.906,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

97,"The food is good and as it should be with in vietnamese taste. My complaint is that I understand all establishments were to have financial gain and financial rewards. To start the price for this restaurant is actually on a pricey side. For example, a special pho is price at $14.95 An order 5 pcs of egg roll for $15.95 apertizer Then they charge an extra $0.25 for to go boxes or containers. A sign post throughout the entire restaurant saying it is a California law, to charge extra for to go containers. . . ""REALLY"". Now, I am wondering how California is going to keep track of how many people dine in and how many people are to go.",2,0.872,positive,"[0.4404, 0.6486, 0.0, 0.4019, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0]",positive,,,,,,,0.6369,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
98,"This is a small Pho restaurant located in a very busy plaza in Rowland Heights. Overall the restaurant is pretty clean and casual like your typical pho restaurant. The tables are pretty close together so it can seem a bit noisy at times. The staff is young and speak fluent English. They have a pretty good menu selection but they don't have the typical Vietnamese dessert drinks which we were a bit disappointed about. The food portions are quite decent. We had their special pho, banh hoi and banh xeo. The banh hoi was very good. The banh xeo however was a bit on the bland side. And the pho was not as strong flavored as I am used to tasting normally. Overall though we had a good experience and I will come back again to see if the flavor may be just a bit off that day.",4,0.909,positive,"[0.0, 0.8481, 0.3612, 0.0, -0.2732, 0.0, 0.4019, 0.4927, 0.0, -0.4023, 0.4404]",positive,,,,,,,0.9168,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
99,"I went on a weekday lunch lots Of people service was ok it's not a big restaurant but there are quite a few table. Parking on weekday lunch is not many but that is due to many other good restaurants in the plaza. I really love pho 79 Alhambra pho soup base this one is pretty good. Pho portion is good size with plenty of noodles and meat. Their thin sliced meat was plentiful has a little fat which I like and the goi cuon spring roll comes with 2 and is tender freshly wrapped. The only reason I gave 4 stars is because even though the pho price is about $15 which the price is aligned with most pho places now but $9 for 2 spring rolls is a bit pricey. Also, i wish there was more variety of meats like tripe, more tendons, beef balls, etc would have made this bowl very appealing. Will definitely be back if in the same area and if I recall right from before their fried egg rolls is really good so I ordered it for big order like ca for a home party before.",4,0.9936,positive,"[0.1531, 0.5927, 0.8908, 0.4404, 0.3041, 0.0, 0.6369, 0.8777]",positive,,,,,,,0.7269,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
100,"Service is your average pho type of place, you order, your food arrives, you eat and you pay. But I've been coming here for years and it would be so wrong of me not to leave them a 5 star review just because of service or just because it's a small pho restaurant. Must order:: summer rolls- ever since they have summer rolls on the menu, I don't bother to drive to Brodard to get my nem nuong roll fix! Tiny vermicelli- legit & so refreshing! The phos here hits the spot, but not the best I've ever had. We came to this restaurant because it's close by and overall great food and great selections!",1,0.6921,positive,"[-0.1027, -0.7403, 0.3244, 0.0, -0.6759, 0.8588]",positive,,,,,,,0.836,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
